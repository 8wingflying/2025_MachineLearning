# 機器學習演算法
- Supervised Learning: Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data.
- Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.
- Semi-Supervised Learning: uses a mix of labeled and unlabeled data, making it helpful when labeling data is costly or time-consuming.
- Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.
